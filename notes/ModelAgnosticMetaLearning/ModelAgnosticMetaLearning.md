# Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks (MAML)
#### Finn, Abbeel and Levine (2017)

In this work, they present a meta-learning algorithm that uses a set of similar tasks in order to provide an initialization point that allows for fast specialization-learning to a new (but similar) task. 

### Main features
