# Summary of [Apprenticeship Learning via Inverse Reinforcement Learning](https://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/icml04-apprentice.pdf) by Pieter Abbeel

## Background
Pretty much the first work that learns simultaneously a reward function and the corresponding policy

## Scope
* Reward function is a linear combination of engineered features of the state
* *Main problem* We have to solve an entire direct RL problem inside the algorithm loop
