# InfoGAN : Interpretable Representation Learning by Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Nets
#### Chen, Duan, Houthooft Schuman Sutskever, Abeel (2016)

The authors apply a simple modification to GANs that allows to learn disentangled and interpretable representations in an unsupervised manner. Their approach is inspired by the notion of *mutual information* borrowed from Information Theory.
